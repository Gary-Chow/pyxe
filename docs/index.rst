Welcome to edi12's documentation!
=================================

The edi12 package provides a simple means to handle Energy Dispersive X-ray Diffraction (EDXD) data from the Diamond Light Source's I12 (EH2) beamline. 




The package's core functionality is to take raw NeXus data files and output enhanced files which include detector specific strain and the associated, complete in-plane strain state.
A plotting module builds upon the analysis framework to allow for the convenient visulisation of strain data, with notable emphasis being placed on the visulisation of 2D-data sets. 
While 3D functionality is planned and partially implemented, this is not currently a priority and support is limited.
