Welcome to edi12's documentation!
=================================

The edi12 package provides a simple means to handle Energy Dispersive X-ray Diffraction (EDXD) data from the Diamond Light Source's I12 (EH2) beamline. 
The package's core functionality is to take raw NeXus data files and output enhanced files which include detector specific strain and the associated in-plane strain state.
A plotting module builds upon the data analysis to allow for the convenient visulisation of strain data, with notable emphasis being placed on the visulisation of 2D-data sets. 
While 3D functionality is planned and partially implemented, this is not currently a priority and support is limited.

1.0 Strain Calculations
-----------------------

Strain is calculated from each specified peak individually (i.e. this is not a Reitveld type refinement) although the strain from many individual peaks may be calculated and stored.
Strain is calculated against the unstrained inter-planar spacing, :math:`d_0`, such that:

.. math::
    \epsilon = \frac{d_n - d_0}{d_0}

or, more specifically, in terms of the scattering vector, q:

.. math::
    \epsilon = \frac{q_0}{q_n - q_0}.

The unstrained lattice parameter (:math:`d_0`) much either be explicity given or specified via a NeXus file containing EDXD measurements from an unstrained source.
A consideration of the methods by which to extract unstrained lattice parameters can be found in work by Withers et al. (REF).


1.1 In-plane strain state
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The detector, and therefore angle, specific strain values can be further utilised to fit and extract a full description of the in-plane strain state.
This is beneficial due to the additional information that is then available, notably the principal in-plane strains and shear strain. 
Further to this, these parameters allow for the extraction of strain at any defined angle. 
This can be more accurate than the equivalent detector specific strain due to the additional information that is effectively leveraged in the calculations.

1.2 Plane-strain stress calculations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In a system in which material along one axis is under constraint and the strain can be approximated to zero, the full strain trensor collapses down to the 2D in-plane state.
This then allows for the convenient calculation of stress. It must be emphasised that this is only a valid calculation in material under plane strain conditions.

2.0 Plotting
------------

In addition to the the extraction and manipulation of strain data, the edi12 package also provides some plotting functions to allow for the visulisation of the strain data.
