PyXe is a package developed to address bottlenecks in the diffraction-strain
analysis workflow. It is vital that X-ray diffraction data acquired during
synchrotron beamtimes is analysed in as close to real time as is possible. This
allows for a tight feedback loop and ensures that decisions regarding
acquisition and experimental parameters are optimized.

The pyXe package therefore aims to allow for the efficient analysis and
visualization of diffraction data acquired from these large scale facilities. It
achieves this through the extraction of strain from individual peaks
(i.e. not a Reitveld type refinement). Peak fitting routines can be run over 1D,
2D and 3D data sets. Peaks and strain are extracted as a function of azimuthal
position (either detector position or caking angle). The resultant strain data
is then further interrogated to facilitate the calculation of principal and
shear strains. Analysed data is stored in the hdf5 file format and can be easily
reloaded and visualised.
