Description: # EDI12 - Energy Dispersive X-ray Diffraction (EDXD) Analysis Package
        
        Version 0.10 - Early beta version.
        
        Package to allow for the analysis and visulisation of data from the I12:JEEP EDXD detector. Specifically aimed at the extraction of strain through individual peak fitting. This package is designed to work with EDXD data stored in the NeXus format specified on the 23 element detector array utilised on the I12 beamline. 
        
        Peaks can be fitted to peaks in 1D, 2D and 3D data sets. The peak fitting is done across all detectors, thereby allowing for the construction of a Mohrs circle and the extraction of shear strain.
